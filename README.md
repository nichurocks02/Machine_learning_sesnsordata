Automatic Labelling
Labelling data can be tedious and time-consuming. This is especially the case when you
have large amounts of data. For data that contains a definite beginning and end, such as
pausing between actions, this can be done automatically. Write an automatic labelling script
for the data provided. Included are 2 sample data files from our collection and labels that
were eventually used.
Implement a tool that would label this data. Notice that there are 2 files for each action - one
is the raw data and the other is processed data. Also, note that even though these files are
label and data extensions, they are both CSV formatted files, so they can be opened with
any text editor.
Feature Generation
In this next problem, we have collected a day worth of data from a cow. The data is
unlabelled and no metadata is available. The data is supposed to be used to identify cow
activities. Since this is 24 hours worth of data, it is expected that most common cow activities
should be encountered within the data. For example; walking, running, eating, ruminating,
and sleeping. There are, of course, other potential activities that the cow could be doing.
Given this data, try to extract features that could help differentiate between different
activities. The sensor data is gyroscope (± 500dps) and accelerometer (± 8g). Note also that
this is the first day of attaching the collar and that some obstacles may have been
encountered.
The expected outcome of this problem is a way to extract as much information as possible.
It’s not a problem with a quantitative solution, but the task is to apply techniques such as
clustering, filtering and processing to visualize information that would not otherwise be
visible. Some ways that the results could be presented: plots of processed data showing
interesting properties, documentation to put some thoughts about the data interpretation,
and/or generated labels in the format shown in the first task. These are suggestions and the
authors are free to convey the results in whatever way they think fits best.
